🔐 Homophonic Substitution Cipher Simulator

This project is a simulation tool for the Homophonic Substitution Cipher, a classical encryption technique designed to make frequency analysis attacks more difficult. In this cipher, each plaintext letter can be replaced by multiple possible cipher symbols, especially for frequently used letters like ‘E’ or ‘A’. This creates a more uniform ciphertext frequency distribution, enhancing security while maintaining the essence of substitution-based encryption.

How it works:

Each plaintext letter is assigned one or more random symbols or numbers.

Common letters get more possible substitutes to balance frequency.

During encryption, the program randomly picks one of the assigned symbols.

Decryption reverses this process using the mapping table.
